            <!-- Etymology -->
            <h3 class="history-heading2">Etymology</h3>
            <p class="history-para">
              The name "Agra" has its roots in ancient history, with its earliest mention in the Mahabharata as "Agravana," meaning "the border of the forest" ('Agra' meaning 'front' or 'border' and 'vana' meaning 'forest'). During the medieval period, particularly under Mughal rule when Persian was the court language, the name likely evolved into its present form, reflecting the linguistic practices of that era. Some scholars suggest an alternative origin from the Sanskrit word "Agar," meaning "saltpan," though this theory is less commonly accepted. Over centuries, the name "Agravana" was simplified to "Agra," mirroring the natural linguistic evolution influenced by various cultures and languages.

              Agra's history spans several centuries and various dynasties, beginning with its mention as 'Agravana' in the Mahabharata. It was established as a modern city by Sikandar Lodi in 1504 and became a significant Mughal city after Babur's conquest in 1526. Under Akbar, Agra became the Mughal capital, where he built the Agra Fort. Shah Jahan later constructed the iconic Taj Mahal. The city experienced decline after Aurangzeb moved the capital to Delhi. Agra came under Maratha control in the 18th century before being taken over by the British in 1803, remaining under their rule until India's independence in 1947. Today, Agra is a major tourist destination known for its UNESCO World Heritage Sites, including the Taj Mahal, Agra Fort, and Fatehpur Sikri. Administratively, Agra is governed by the Agra Municipal Corporation (AMC) for local civic services, while the District Magistrate oversees law and order and revenue collection. The Divisional Commissioner coordinates regional administration, with broader oversight from the Uttar Pradesh state government and certain central government agencies managing historical sites. The Agra Police Commissionerate ensures public safety, and the Agra Development Authority (ADA) handles urban planning and infrastructure development.

            <h3 class="history-heading2">Agriculture</h3>
            <p class="history-para">Agriculture plays a vital role in Agra's economy, supported by its fertile soil and favorable climate. The region benefits from the alluvial plains of the Yamuna River, which provide rich agricultural land. Major crops grown in Agra include wheat, paddy, maize, and barley, with wheat being the predominant crop due to the region's favorable conditions for its cultivation. In addition to cereals, Agra also produces significant quantities of pulses, oilseeds, and a variety of vegetables.
              <br>
              Horticulture is another important aspect of Agra's agriculture, with crops such as guava, mango, and pomegranate being widely cultivated. The city is also known for its floriculture, with marigold, rose, and other ornamental flowers grown extensively for both local markets and export. Additionally, Agra's agriculture includes the cultivation of cash crops like cotton and sugarcane, which contribute to the local economy.
              <br>
              Irrigation plays a crucial role in Agra's agricultural productivity, with the Yamuna River and an extensive network of canals providing essential water resources. Traditional farming methods are gradually being complemented by modern techniques, including the use of high-yielding variety seeds, chemical fertilizers, and advanced irrigation systems. Government initiatives and agricultural extension services also support farmers by providing training and resources to improve crop yields and sustainability.
              <br>
              Overall, agriculture in Agra is a mix of traditional practices and modern advancements, contributing significantly to the livelihoods of its rural population and the overall economy of the region.
